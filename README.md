### Learn test-driven development with Elixir <a href="#learn-test-driven-development-with-go" id="learn-test-driven-development-with-go"></a>

* Explore the Elixir language by writing tests
* **Get a grounding with TDD**. Elixir is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in
* Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Elixir
